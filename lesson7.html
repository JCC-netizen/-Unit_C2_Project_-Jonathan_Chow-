    <h1>Lesson 7: Best Practices for HTML</h1>
    <p>Writing clean, semantic HTML is important for creating accessible, maintainable websites. By following best practices, such as using proper indentation, including alt text for images, and ensuring your code is valid, you ensure that your website is readable by both humans and search engines.</p>

    <h2>Example HTML Code:</h2>
    <pre>
        &lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Main Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>By including proper descriptions and headings, you ensure a better user experience and improved SEO.</p>
