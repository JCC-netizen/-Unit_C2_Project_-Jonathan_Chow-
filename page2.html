    <h1>Lesson 1: What is HTML?</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it's the backbone of the World Wide Web. It's a language that uses tags to define the structure and content of web pages. You can think of it like the blueprint for a house in that it tells the browser how to display text, images, videos, and other elements. These tags tell the browser how to interpret and render the content.</p>

    <p>HTML is the language that drives the modern World Wide Web. It has a long history of evolution. It all began in 1991 when Tim Berners-Lee was working at CERN, developing the first version of HTML. This first version, with only 18 tags, supported basic document formatting and linking-just what was needed for a connected web. As years passed, HTML evolved and started to mature by implementing features such as forms, tables, and multimedia, among others, that incredibly increased its accessibility. The web was way more interactive and pleasant for the eyes.</p>

        <p>But the most significant update came in the form of HTML5, finalized in 2014. HTML5 brings in new elements for multimedia, improved semantic elements that hint at better structure and meaning, and APIs that perk up the development of more impressive web applications. This was a quantum leap in the capability of the web and opened the way to more vibrant and dynamic web experiences. Today, HTML is still evolving with ongoing updates and improvements to ensure that the web stays a dynamic, ever-changing medium. From humble beginnings, it has become the backbone of the Internet.</p>
