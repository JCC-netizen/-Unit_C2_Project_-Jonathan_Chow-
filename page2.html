    <h1>Lesson 1: What is HTML?</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it's the backbone of the World Wide Web. It's a language that uses tags to define the structure and content of web pages. You can think of it like the blueprint for a house in that it tells the browser how to display text, images, videos, and other elements. These tags tell the browser how to interpret and render the content. While it is not a full-fledged programming language in and of itself, it usually works in cooperation with other technologies for styling, such as CSS, and with JavaScript for interactivity, to bring about the dynamic websites that we have come to know today.</p>
    <h2>Example HTML Code:</h2>
    <pre>
        &lt;html&gt;
            &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to HTML!&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is an introduction to HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>On the webpage, this code would display a heading saying "Welcome to HTML!" and a paragraph that says "This is an introduction to HTML." The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag defines the heading, and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> defines a paragraph.</p>
